## How it works

- [Retrofit](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit) with [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) is used to request the api.
- A [Blo–°](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) is used for state management.
- A [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive_flutter) is used to store facts.
- The application supports [localization](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_localization) (languages: English as a base, Ukrainian, French, Hebrew).

## Basic functions
